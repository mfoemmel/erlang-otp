            The erlang ssh server has presented itself incorrectly,
            using the special version ssh-1.99, although it never has
            supported versions below 2.0. Since ssh-1.1 client
            versions below 2.0 are correctly rejected instead of
            letting the server crash later on. Alas the problem with
            the presentation string was not discovered until after
            ssh.1.1 was released. Now the server will present itself
            as ssh-2.0.</p>

            Ssh timeouts will now behave as expected e.i. defaults to
            infinity only the user of the ssh application can know of
            a reasonable timeout value for their application.</p>

            The implementation of timeouts added as a patch in
            ssh-1.0.1 was slightly changed and is now documented.</p>

            To honor the multiplexing of channels over one ssh
            connection concept ssh_sftp:connect/ [1,2,3] is
            deprecated and replaced by ssh_sftp:start_channel/[1,2,3]
            and ssh_sftp:stop/1 is deprecated and replaced by
            ssh_sftp:stop_channel/1 and to stop the ssh connection
            ssh:close/ 1 should be called.</p>

            Added the message {ssh_channel_up, ChannelId,
            ConnectionManager} that shall be handled by the channel
            callback handle_msg/2. This makes the function
            handle_msg/2 a mandatory function for ssh channels
            implementations which it was not in ssh-1.1.</p>

      <p>
	A flaw in the implementation of the supervison tree
	caused the ssh deamon to close the connections to all
	currently logged in users if one user logged out. Another
	problem related to the supervison tree caused the closing
	down of clients to leak processes e.i. all processes was
      not shutdown correctly.</p>

	[sftp, sftpd] - Added patch to make sftp timestamps more
	correct, in the long run it would be nice to have better
	support in file to be able to make it always behave
	correctly now it will be correct 99 % of time instead of
      almost never correct, at least on unix-based platforms.</p>

	Ssh incorrectly sent the local id instead of the remote
	id of a channel to the peer. For simpler cases these ids
	often happen to have the same value. One case when they
	do not is when the client sends an exec command two times
	in a raw on the same ssh connection (different channels
	of course as the channel will be closed when the exec
      command has been evaluated) .</p>

	Packet data could be lost under high load due to the fact
	that buffered data was sometimes wrongly discarded before
      it had been sent.</p>

	Ssh now rejects old versions of the ssh protocol for
	security reasons. (Even if they where not correctly
	rejected before the connection would probably have failed
      anyway due to other reasons.)</p>

      <p>
	New API module ssh_channel has been added. This is a
	behaviour to facilitate the implementation of ssh clients
	and plug in subsystems to the ssh daemon. Note that this
	slightly changes the options to the API function
	ssh:daemon/[1,2,3] deprecating all no longer documented
	options. Note that the new API enforces the "logical way"
	of using the old API e.i. making the subsystem process
	part of the ssh applications supervisor tree, so missuses
      of the old API are not compatible with the new API.</p>

            A few minor bugs where fixed in ssh_userreg.erl and
            ssh_connection_manager and a a ssh_cli option was added
            to restore backwards compatiblity with the old ssh_cm -
            API.</p>

            The architecture of the ssh processes has been
