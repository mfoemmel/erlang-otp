            A BIT STRING with a size constraint that has a single
            value and an extension as in <c> BIT STRING (SIZE
            (16,...))</c> was erronous encoded/decoded. This is now
            corrected and follows X.691 Section 15.6.</p>

            A corrupted encoding may cause a loop when a buffer of at

            The precedence rules for extended constraints have been
            misinterpreted. The rule says for instance that if there
            are more than one constraint on a type that have
            extensionmark, only the last of the extensionmarks would
            be kept. This affects the encoding of PER and is now
            corrected.</p>

            Now the asn1-compiler supports two root lists in SEQUENCE
            and SET according to alternative three in
            ComponentTypeLists (X.680 07/2002 section 24.1), i.e.
            with an extension list between two ellipses.</p>

          <p>When copiling an asn1 source that reference a type in

            other source to resolve the reference. It also tests
            whether the other source has been updated since the
            asn1db file was generated. This last test was to brutal
            in that it exits compilation when no source was found,
            even though a asn1db file existed. Changed behaviour from
            a brutal exit to a warning.</p>
