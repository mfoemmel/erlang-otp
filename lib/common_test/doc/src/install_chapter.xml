    <title>Unix</title>

    <p>Copy the Common Test and Test Server application
    directories, <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> and
    <c><![CDATA[test_server-<vsn>]]></c>, to a location of your choice. They do
    not have to be placed among the Erlang applications under the OTP
    lib directory, nor do they need to have a particular path relative
    to your test suite modules. In the Common Test directory you
    find the shell script <c>install.sh</c>. Execute this script
    to generate the Common Test start script <c>run_test</c> in the
    sub directory <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>/priv/bin]]></c>.</p>

    <p><c>install.sh</c> takes one input parameter which specifies the
    absolute path to the top directory of Common Test and Test
    Server. (This path is inserted in the <c>run_test</c> script so
    that when the script starts Erlang, the Erlang code server will be
    able to load the Common Test and Test Server application
    modules). Example (assuming Common Test and Test Server have been
    placed in <c>/usr/local/test_tools</c>):</p>

    <p><c> 
    $ install.sh /usr/local/test_tools
    </c></p>

    <p>Note that the <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> and
    <c><![CDATA[test_server-<vsn>]]></c> directories must be located under the
    same top directory for the installation to work properly. Note also
    that the install script does not e.g. copy files or update environment
    variables. It only generates the <c>run_test</c> script.</p> 
    
    <p>If the directories are later moved, make sure to run <c>install.sh</c>
    again or edit the <c>run_test</c> script (Bourne shell) manually.</p> 

    <p>For more information on the <c>run_test</c> script, please see
    the reference manual.</p>

    <title>Windows</title>

    <p>On Windows it is very convenient to use Cygwin (<c>www.cygwin.com</c>)
    for running Common Test and Erlang, since it enables you to use the
    <c>run_test</c> script for starting Common Test. If you are a Cygwin
    user, simply follow the instructions for installing Common Test 
    on Unix above.</p>

    <p>If you do not use Cygwin, you have to rely on the API functions
    in the <c>ct</c> module (instead of <c>run_test</c>) for running
    Common Test. In this case you do not need to install Common Test
    (i.e. no need to generate the <c>run_test</c> script). Simply copy the
    <c><![CDATA[common_test-<vsn>]]></c> and <c><![CDATA[test_server-<vsn>]]></c> 
    directories to a location of your choice. They do not have to be placed among
    the Erlang applications under the OTP lib directory, nor do they
    need to have a particular path relative to your test suite
    modules.</p>

    <p>When you start the Erlang node on which you will be running
    Common Test, make sure the Common Test and Test Server <c>ebin</c> 
    directories are included in the Erlang code server path (so the
    application modules can be loaded). If you do copy the application
    directories to the OTP lib directory, there is no need to
    explicitly update the code server path as the code server will be
    able to locate the modules automatically.</p>
