      <p><em>Common Test</em> is a portable application for automated 
      testing. It is suitable for black-box testing of target
      systems of any type (i.e. not necessarily implemented in Erlang),
      as well as for white-box testing of Erlang/OTP programs.
      Black-box testing is performed via standard O&amp;M 
      interfaces (such as SNMP, HTTP, Corba, Telnet, etc) and,
      if required, via user specific interfaces (often called test 
      ports). White-box testing of Erlang/OTP programs is easily
      accomplished by calling the target API functions directly
      from the test case functions. Common Test also integrates 
      usage of the OTP cover tool for code coverage analysis of 
      Erlang/OTP programs.</p>
      
      <p>Common Test executes test suite programs automatically,
      without operator interaction. Test progress and results is
      printed to logs on HTML format, easily browsed with a standard
      web browser. Common Test also sends notifications about progress
      and results via an OTP event manager to event handlers plugged
      in to the system. This way users can integrate their own
      programs for e.g. logging, database storing or supervision with
      Common Test.</p>

      <p>Common Test provides libraries that contain useful support 
      functions to fill various testing needs and requirements. 
      There is for example support for flexible test declarations 
      by means of so called test specifications. There is also support 
      for central configuration and control of multiple 
      independent test sessions (towards different target systems)
      running in parallel.</p>

      <p>Common Test is implemented as a framework based on the OTP Test 
      Server application.</p>
